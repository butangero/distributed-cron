distributed-cron
================
Distributed Cron is a set of perl scripts that uses gearman job servers and the API to send tasks in a queue to the job servers and then the different workers runs the script that identifies a task. Basically the workers runs the script cron_worker.pl that will gets all the tasks name from the job server and will runs the script defined in the json file.
The clients just will send the name of the task to the job server that will gets the worker servers. To run the client script we've to run the script cron_client.pl with the --tasks parameter that accepts the name of one or more tasks separated by spaces. Usage example:

./cron_client.pl --tasks task1 task2
